            <div class="subtitle">Payments</div>
            <p>
                When You book an appointment with a Service Provider, Tambong provides and is responsible for
                the System - but not the Experience and Quality of Services provided by the Service
                Provider. When You book for an appointment, You agree to pay the cost of the Services,
                including any charges and taxes that may apply.
                For some Services, You may be required to make an upfront payment and/or a payment taken at
                the time of the Service delivery.
            </p>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>If we organize Your payment,</strong> We (or, in some cases, our affiliate) will
                    be responsible for managing Your payment and ensuring the completion of Your transaction
                    with the Service Provider. In this case, Your payment constitutes final settlement of
                    the 'due and payable' price.</li>
                <li><strong>If the Service Provider charges You (i.e. payment on arrival),</strong>
                    this will usually be in person at the start of the Service delivery, but it could also
                    be (for example) that Your credit card is charged when You book online. This depends on
                    the upfront payment policy of the Service Provider as communicated to You in the booking
                    process.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            If the Service Provider requires an Upfront Payment, it may be taken or pre-authorized when You
            make Your booking, and depending on the Service Provider’s upfront payment policy, it may be
            non-refundable. Before You book, PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE SERVICE PROVIDER’S UPFRONT POLICY,
            which We do not influence and are not responsible for.
            An E-Invoice will be issued by Tambong as a proof of payment; however the Service will be
            delivered by the Service Provider.
            We may store your Payment Method details for future transactions after collecting Your consent.
            If You know of or suspect any fraud or unauthorized use of your Payment Method, please
            immediately contact Us to enable Us to take the necessary action with the concerned payment
            department.

            <br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Cancellation and Refunds</div>
            If You cancel an appointment or do not show up, any cancellation/no-show fee and any refund will
            depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation/no-show policy. Before You book, PLEASE CAREFULLY
            READ THE SERVICE PROVIDER’S CANCELLATION /NO-SHOW POLICY, which We do not influence and are not
            responsible for.
            Some bookings cannot be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a
            deadline.
